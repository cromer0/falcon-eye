# SysMonPro Environment Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual configuration values.

# --- Database Configuration ---
# Specifies the type of database to use.
# Options: "sqlite", "postgres"
DATABASE_TYPE="sqlite"

# Path to the SQLite database file. Used only if DATABASE_TYPE is "sqlite".
# Ensure the directory exists or the application has rights to create it.
DATABASE_PATH="data/sys_stats.db"

# Connection URL for PostgreSQL. Used only if DATABASE_TYPE is "postgres".
# Format: postgresql://username:password@host:port/dbname
DATABASE_URL=""


# --- Data Collection ---
# Interval in seconds for collecting historical system statistics for each monitored server.
HISTORICAL_DATA_COLLECTION_INTERVAL="60"

# Maximum number of historical data entries to keep per server in the database.
# Example: 1440 entries at a 60s interval means 1 day of data.
MAX_HISTORICAL_ENTRIES="1440"

# Unique identifier used in the database for the local server (where this app runs)
# if it's monitored by default (i.e., not explicitly listed in REMOTE_SERVER_X variables with is_local=true).
DEFAULT_LOCAL_HOST_ID="localhost_monitored"

# Display name for the default local server if monitored automatically.
LOCAL_SERVER_NAME="Local Server (App Host)"


# --- Remote Server SSH ---
# Timeout in seconds for establishing SSH connections to remote servers.
SSH_TIMEOUT="25"


# --- Alerting System ---
# Interval in seconds for evaluating alert conditions against the collected data.
ALERT_EVALUATION_INTERVAL="60"


# --- Email Notifications (for Alerts) ---
# SMTP server address for sending email alerts.
SMTP_SERVER="" # e.g., "smtp.gmail.com" or "your.smtp.server.com"

# SMTP server port. Common ports are 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL).
SMTP_PORT="587"

# Username for SMTP authentication (if required).
SMTP_USER=""

# Password for SMTP authentication (if required).
SMTP_PASSWORD=""

# Email address from which alerts will be sent.
SMTP_SENDER_EMAIL="" # e.g., "alerts@example.com"


# --- Remote Server Configurations (examples) ---
# You can define multiple remote servers to monitor.
# Copy and increment the number (REMOTE_SERVER_1, REMOTE_SERVER_2, etc.) for each server.

REMOTE_SERVER_1_NAME="Server One"
REMOTE_SERVER_1_HOST="server.one.example.com" # Unique hostname or IP
REMOTE_SERVER_1_USER="your_ssh_user"
REMOTE_SERVER_1_PASSWORD="your_ssh_password" # Option 1: Use password (less secure)
# REMOTE_SERVER_1_KEY_PATH="~/.ssh/id_rsa_server_one" # Option 2: Path to SSH private key (more secure)
# REMOTE_SERVER_1_KEY_PASSPHRASE="" # Passphrase for the SSH key, if any
REMOTE_SERVER_1_PORT="22" # Default SSH port
REMOTE_SERVER_1_DISK_PATH="/" # Disk path to monitor on this server (e.g., "/", "/mnt/data")

REMOTE_SERVER_2_NAME="Server Two via Jump"
REMOTE_SERVER_2_HOST="server.two.internal"
REMOTE_SERVER_2_USER="your_ssh_user_two"
REMOTE_SERVER_2_PASSWORD="password_for_server_two"
REMOTE_SERVER_2_PORT="22"
REMOTE_SERVER_2_DISK_PATH="/"
# Example of using a Jump Server:
# REMOTE_SERVER_2_JUMP_SERVER="1" # The number (index) of the server defined above to use as a jump host (e.g., REMOTE_SERVER_1)

# To monitor the machine where this app runs as one of the servers in the list (useful if it's not just a monitoring station):
# This allows its stats to be collected and alerted on via the same mechanism as remote servers.
# REMOTE_SERVER_3_NAME="This Monitoring Server"
# REMOTE_SERVER_3_HOST="monitoring.host.id" # This should be a unique ID for the DB. Can be same as DEFAULT_LOCAL_HOST_ID.
# REMOTE_SERVER_3_IS_LOCAL="true" # Special flag to indicate local data collection (no SSH)
# REMOTE_SERVER_3_USER="local" # User is not strictly needed for local, but good to set.
# REMOTE_SERVER_3_DISK_PATH="/" # Disk path to monitor on this local machine.
# Note: If is_local=true, SSH details (HOST (as in resolvable), PORT, PASSWORD, KEY_PATH, JUMP_SERVER) are ignored for this entry,
# but HOST (as an identifier) and NAME are still used.
# The local data collection will use the DEFAULT_LOCAL_HOST_ID if no `is_local: true` server is defined with that ID.

# Add more server configurations as needed:
# REMOTE_SERVER_X_NAME="..."
# REMOTE_SERVER_X_HOST="..."
# ...
